// Puddles: the rain half of accumulation.
//
// Art is Client/Data/Effect/WeatherPuddle.img, built by build_weather_puddle.py.
// It is GENERATED rather than borrowed because every water asset in v83 is lit pool
// water seen from the side, which on dirt reads as glowing ice. The one real piece kept
// is the Ellinia surface ripple, used as the moving sheen ON the puddle rather than as
// the puddle itself. See that script for the reasoning.
//
// HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM weatheraccum.cpp, which it otherwise mirrors
// -------------------------------------------------------------------
//   1. A PUDDLE GROWS, IT DOES NOT MULTIPLY. Snow gets denser as it falls; standing
//      water gets wider. So a slot holds exactly one puddle and rain PROMOTES it through
//      three size tiers, rather than stacking a second one beside it.
//   2. IT NEEDS FLAT GROUND. Water does not sit on a slope. The check does not read
//      CFoothold fields: the struct offsets past +0x0C were never verified, and a bad
//      raw deref here would be a crash rather than a cosmetic bug. Instead the surface
//      height is sampled twice more, left and right of the candidate, using the same
//      GetFootholdUnderneath call that found it. Three cheap queries beat one unverified
//      pointer dereference.
//   3. SPLASHES AIM AT IT. WeatherPuddle_PickWetX lets weathersplash bias some of its
//      drops onto standing water, so the two systems look connected instead of
//      coincidental.
//   4. IT CAN BE STEPPED IN. Landing in or walking into a puddle throws water up, through
//      the same splash art. See StepInteraction.

// THE SLOPE PROBE. DO NOT WIDEN PUDDLE_PROBE_DX TO COVER THE SPRITE -- that is the

// gradient limit. Widening the arm to 35 while leaving the tolerance at 3 silently
// tightens that to 1:11.7, which strips most eligible ground off any ramp-heavy map and
// makes every flat run shorter than 71 px permanently dry. It would also fail placement
// far more often, and a failed placement falls through to PROMOTING an existing puddle,

//
// EDGE_DY is deliberately looser than PUDDLE_MAX_SLOPE and must stay that way. It is an
