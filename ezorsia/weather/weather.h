// Server-authoritative day/night + weather.
//
// The client owns RENDERING only. It holds no opinion about what time it is:
// the world clock lives on the server and arrives as LP 0x373D, so every player
// sees the same sky at the same moment. There are no hotkeys.
//
// Between packets the client advances its own copy of the clock, so the server
// does not have to broadcast every in-game minute. A packet is a re-sync, not a
// tick: one on map entry and one whenever the sky state actually changes is
// enough, and a late or dropped packet only means the clock drifts by the
// scheduling error until the next one.
//
// WIRE (must match server/weather/WeatherPackets.java field for field):
//   short  opcode            0x373D
//   short  minuteOfDay       0..1439, in-game minutes past midnight
//   int    msPerGameMinute   real milliseconds per in-game minute
//   byte   sky               Weather::SKY_*
//   byte   flags             bit0 = snap (no fade), used on map entry
//   int    skyElapsedSec     how long this sky has held, capped at 3600
//   byte   tintR             the region's night colour, a multiply against the map art
//   byte   tintG
//   byte   tintB
//   short  rainbowSecsLeft   seconds of after-the-rain rainbow still owed
//   byte   palette           client-owned dusk/night palette id (optional)
//   int    skyElapsedMs      precise age for synchronized cosmetic lightning (optional)
//   int    skyToken          per-sky cosmetic seed (optional)
// Twenty-six bytes after the opcode. 0x373C is the reserved recv twin under the house
// even-request / odd-reply convention and is unused: the client never asks.
