// WHICH BRANCH RUNS. The weather builder at 0x0063FE57 has a seven way switch at
// 0x006404C0 on its third argument. That argument is info/**direction**, NOT info/type:
//
//   0x00534C48  push 0xEC5                 string pool id for "direction"
//   0x00534C76  call VariantToIntOrDefault
//   0x00534C7B  mov [ebp-0x24], eax
//   0x00534F33  push [ebp-0x24]            becomes the builder's [ebp+0x10]
//
// No weather item carries a `direction` child, ours or stock, so every ambient sky lands
// in branch 0. A cave placed in any other branch installs cleanly and never executes.
//
// BRANCH 0, at 0x006406BD:
//   006406BD  rand()%800   startX = that - SCREEN_WIDTH_MAX/2
//   006406CF  rand()%600   startY = that - SCREEN_HEIGHT_MAX/2
//   006406E3  rand()%200
//   006406F3  lea eax,[edx+eax-0x64]   endX = startX + rand()%200 - 100   <- THE DRIFT
//   006406F7  mov [ebp-0x2c],eax
//   006406FA  lea eax,[ebx+0x12c]      endY = startY + SCREEN_HEIGHT_MAX/2
//
// The stock spread is only +/-100 px over a whole fall, which reads as a wobble rather
// than as wind. This cave widens it and adds a prevailing gust.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT DO. 0x0063FE57 is a one shot BUILDER and the RelMove it feeds is
// nType = VM_FOREVER, so a particle keeps its trajectory for life. The per particle
// spread is therefore the continuous effect; the prevailing gust is rolled once per
// build, so it changes on a sky change or a map entry but does not swell while a sky
// holds. Animating it would mean re-blowing the weather, and BlowWeather calls
// WeatherLayer_RemoveAll first, so every particle would pop. Nothing here needs a per
// frame tick. The prevailing gust itself is derived from the server's per-sky token,
// so every client in the same region agrees on its direction and strength.
//
// REGISTER LIVENESS AT 0x006406F3:
//   eax  the value being computed. Overwritten at 0x006406FA, free afterwards.
//   edx  rand()%200. Only consumer is the instruction being replaced. Dead after.
//   ecx  holds 200. Dead.
//   ebx  startY, read at 0x006406FA. MUST SURVIVE.
//   esi  SCREEN_HEIGHT_MAX/2, edi SCREEN_WIDTH_MAX/2. Not written here.
//   ebp  the builder's frame. The cave reads [ebp-0x20] and writes [ebp-0x2c] through
//        it, which is safe because a naked stub sets up no frame of its own.
// The callee is __cdecl, whose volatile set is eax/ecx/edx: exactly the dead three.
//
// resolution.cpp rewrites constants at 0x006406C3+1, 0x006406D5+1 and 0x006406FA+2 in
// this same branch. This cave owns 0x006406F3..0x006406F9 and overlaps none of them, but
// it must still install AFTER AttachResolutionMod.

// about 300 to 400px and is a constant resolution.cpp owns. The angle of the path is
// therefore decided entirely by how far the particle travels HORIZONTALLY in the same
// time, which is exactly what this cave returns. At 1200 to 1800 against a ~350 fall the

// about 12 degrees and a third of snowfalls arrive under it: straight down, as reported.
