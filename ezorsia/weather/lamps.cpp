//
// HISTORY, because the comment here used to describe art that is no longer used. The glows
// were originally STOCK canvases (acc7/mureungTW/market/2 and friends), and those really
// do carry a0/a1 alpha ramps the engine drives on its own clock: every lamp's copy started
// at map load, so they pulsed in unison and the per-frame colour write in ApplyGlows lost
// to the animator. That is what this function was written for.
//
// The glows are now DRAWN (Map/Obj/MapleMoonLamp.img, build_lamp_glows.py) and every
// one of them is a single frame with no animator, so on the glow path this is a no-op.
// It is kept, and still called, because the LAMP path genuinely needs it: several stock
// fixtures animate themselves (see kaentakeKeep and LampStaticFrame), and a map's own lamp
// object is recognised by its sprite rather than by a tag of ours.
//
// So the per-frame colour write in ApplyGlows is NOT justified by an animator any more.
// It is justified by the engine re-asserting layer alpha, which is the same reason the
// tiled backdrop has to be re-asserted; see IMPLEMENTATION.md.
//
// Two attempts, cheapest first. Animate(GA_STOP) may be enough on its own; if the layer
// still carries more canvases afterwards, the extras are removed so there is nothing left
// to animate between. Both are guarded, and if both fail the only cost is the pulse.
