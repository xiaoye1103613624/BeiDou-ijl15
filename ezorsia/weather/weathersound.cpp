// The ambient rain loop, played through the client's own CSoundMan so it follows the
// SOUND EFFECTS slider.
//
// WHY NOT RAW IWzSound. An earlier version owned the voice directly so it could track a
// different slider, and it never made a sound: IWzSound::Play only CREATES the voice.
// What starts it is put_playing, which PlaySE does immediately afterwards
// (Play(0) -> put_volume -> put_playing(bLoop ? -1: 1), 0x0043FDAB / 0x0043FDE0). With
// that missing, Play threw a _com_error every single frame, which the crash log caught
// as a repeating trace through WeatherFx::Update -> WeatherSound_Tick.
//
// Going through PlaySE fixes that by construction and is the right call anyway: it is
// the code path 24 stock call sites already use, it applies the SFX master for free
// (put_volume(m_nSEVolume * nVolume / 100)), and it owns the IWzSound cache so the
// megabyte is decoded once.
//
// The node is built by build_weather_sound.py: a seamless 60 s loop reusing the
// media-type header of an existing 44.1 kHz stereo 128 kbps node, with the ID3 tag and
// Xing frame stripped so the stream starts on a frame sync like every stock node does.
// Sound/Weather.img is a file stock v83 never had, which works because resman.cpp mounts
// Client/Data as a NameSpace#FileSystem over the packed archives.

//   Handle ONLY when bLoop is set. Throws _com_error if the path does not resolve
//   (0x0043FD46 raises 0x80004003 on a null sound), and returns -1 rather than 0 when
