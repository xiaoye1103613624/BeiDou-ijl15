// Snow, leaves and petals settling on footholds the longer a sky holds.
//
// Art is Client/Data/Effect/WeatherAccum.img, built by build_weather_accum.py out
// of the same particle sprites that fall, squashed flat and dimmed so a deposit lies on
// the ground instead of standing on its edge. Each variant is its own single-frame
// directory because CreateAnimLayer treats a node's numbered children as FRAMES, so
// pointing it at a multi-sprite weather node would animate one deposit through all of
// them.
//
// THE MODEL
// ---------
// A single level, 0 to 1, rises while an accumulating sky is in force and decays when it
// is not. The number of deposits that SHOULD exist is level * ACCUM_MAX. Every frame the
// live count is nudged one step toward that number, which makes growth and melt fall out
// of the same two lines and keeps the count self correcting after a cull.
//
// Placement is by SLOT, not by random x. The visible world is divided into fixed-width
// columns and a deposit claims one; a second deposit in a claimed slot stacks slightly
// above and offset. Purely random x looks like litter, because clumps and gaps appear at
// the wrong scale. Slots also give an O(n) way to ask what is already covered.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
//   - synchronise deposit POSITIONS between players. The sky is server authoritative and
//     so is its AGE (Weather::SkyElapsedSec, from LP 0x373D), so everyone entering a map
//     that has been snowing for ten minutes sees ten minutes of drifts at the same
//     density. Where each drift sits is still chosen locally, so two players see
//     different arrangements. That is indistinguishable in play and costs one int on the
//     wire instead of a per-map deposit list.

// FOOTPRINTS
// ----------
// Walking through settled snow leaves a trail of hollows, and clears the drift where the
// player trod. Clearing frees the slot, so the ordinary placement loop refills it: snow
// grows back over a track without a single line of code that knows that is what it is
// doing. Prints are part of THIS module rather than their own for that reason; they need
// the slot list, and the slot list is here.
//
// Snow only. A footprint in fallen leaves would have to disturb them rather than dent
// them, which is a different effect, and petals are too sparse to walk through.
