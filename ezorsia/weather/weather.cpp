// Server-authoritative day/night, on every map that has a sky.
//
// WHAT CHANGED FROM THE PACKAGE THIS WAS PORTED FROM, and why:
//
//  1. NO HOTKEYS. F6/F7/F8 polling is gone. State arrives as LP 0x373D from
//     server/weather/WeatherPackets.java, so every player in the world sees the
//     same sky. The client advances its own clock between packets, so a dropped
//     packet costs drift, not correctness.
//
//  2. NO HARDCODED MAP LIST. g_aWeatherFieldIDs (14 entries, half of them test
//     maps) is replaced by FieldHasSky(), a data rule that reads the field's own
//     property. See its comment for the rule and its measured accuracy.
//
//  3. NO INJECTED nightDesert BACKDROP. The original hid each map's own sky behind
//     15 injected desert-sky layers and tinted only what sat in front. That is
//     wrong once this runs everywhere: it pastes a desert over Ellinia, and it
//     costs the contiguity requirement, the hand-maintained NIGHT_INJECT_COUNT,
//     the HILL_Z promotion, and the tall-view seam snap. Instead the map's OWN
//     sky backs are tinted like everything else, so every map darkens into its
//     own night. The cost is the starfield, which belongs to a per-map profile
//     rather than to every map in the game (IMPLEMENTATION.md).
//
//  4. ONE COLOUR WRITE. IWzGr2DLayer::color carries alpha AND a multiply tint in
//     one dword, so the night tint and the weather fade are now combined in
//     Argb() instead of fighting over the same property.
//
// What is kept verbatim, because it is all load-bearing and hard-won:
//   - the single IWzGr2D::CreateLayer capture hook and its scoped-flag routing
//   - RAII ScopedSet, so a thrown loader cannot leave a capture flag stuck on
//   - the RestoreBack re-arm (resolution / zoom rebuilds do not pass LoadMap)
//   - re-asserting layer colour EVERY frame (the engine's per-tile animator
//     overwrites it otherwise)
//   - exact cx/cy tile sizing, to avoid the double-blended seam lines

// The sky table. One row per profile id; see weather_profiles.inc for the field
// meanings and for why the ORDER is load-bearing.
// constexpr, not const: the name anchors below have to read sName at compile time.

// the middle: add an enum value and a row together and the count still matches while

// contact sheet; weather_base_backgrounds.png is the result) using opacity
// plus hue, then hand-corrected for the warm skies colour cannot recognise, of which
// Kerning's sunsetCity is the clearest.
//
// Result: 2834 of 5381 maps (52.7%) get weather. That is 57 banks, not the 59
// originally classified: shineWood2 (21 maps) and department (76 maps) were pulled
// back out as interiors, and the table's own header records why. Verified correct on all of Henesys,
// Ellinia, Perion, Kerning, Lith Harbor, Orbis, El Nath, Ludibrium, Leafre, Mu Lung,
// Ariant, Temple of Time, Florina, Mushroom Castle, Folk Town, Amoria (sky) and Ant
// Tunnel, Kerning subway, Aqua Road, Zakum's altar and lab, Sleepy Dungeon, Mu Lung
// Dojo, Ludibrium dungeon, Abandoned Tower (no sky).
//
// TWO THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE EDITING:
//
//   1. It is a WHITELIST. Anything unrecognised gets no weather, which is the safe
//      direction: a missed sky is a map that looks stock, a false positive is rain
//      falling inside a cave.
//   2. Opacity matters as much as colour. mureung/46 has mean RGB (253,253,253) but
//      is only 21% opaque: it is a cloud sprite over a black void, and all 90 Mu Lung
//      Dojo maps behind it render black. Classifying on colour alone puts snow in the
//      Dojo.
//

// already the right key for "what does night look like here".

// A TEST. Bushes, flowers and grass tufts nudged from side to side, gently in fair
// weather and faster in a storm.
//
// WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, stated up front so the result is judged for what it is. A real
// sway BENDS: the base stays planted and the top leans. That needs a shear, and
// IWzGr2DLayer has none, so this TRANSLATES the whole sprite instead. At two pixels the
// base slides two pixels, and whether that reads as wind or as sliding is the entire
// question this is here to answer. If it reads as sliding, the next thing to try is
// InterLockedOffset with DIFFERENT deltas for the lt and rb corners, which deforms the
// layer rect rather than moving it; that is untested because whether this engine's
// renderer stretches a sprite into its rect or merely clips it is not knowable from the
// WzLib headers, which forward straight into Gr2D_DX8.dll.
//
// WHICH OBJECTS. By NAME first, then by size.
//
// Size alone was the first cut and it was wrong in the way that matters: it swayed
// benches, signposts and rope rungs, because "small and near the ground" describes those
// just as well as it describes a bush. Objects carry their identity in oS/l0/l1/l2, and
// CMapLoadable::MakeObj already hands that property to a hook lamps.cpp owns, so the name
// is available at the moment the layer is built.
//
// The foliage whitelist is the l1 CATEGORY and it is deliberately narrow. Map/Obj has 818
// distinct categories, and the two biggest, `acc` at 1641 groups and `basic` at 641, are
// mixed buckets holding foliage and furniture side by side. Admitting those would put the
// benches straight back. So this UNDER selects: some bushes in the mixed buckets will
// stand still. That is the right way round to be wrong.
//
