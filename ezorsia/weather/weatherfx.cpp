// Every visual parameter is read off the current profile row (weather_profiles.inc),
// so adding a sky is a line of data. Changed from the original package: no F7/F8 polling
// (the sky is server state), the injection is self-contained here, and the colour
// comes from weather.cpp so the night tint and the fade share one dword.

#define FX_RAIN_COUNT    4
// Falling snow: two imported sheets rather than the engine's particle blower.
//
// The particle path is still there and is still what a blizzard and a sandstorm use. Snow
// moved off it because these two planes carry a depth cue the particle engine cannot: one
// sheet BEHIND the map art and one IN FRONT of the player, with the near one larger,
// brighter and falling twice as fast. BlowWeather picks a variant per particle at random,
// so size, brightness and speed are uncorrelated there by construction, and the depth
// reads as noise instead of distance.
#define FX_SNOW_COUNT    2
// THE BLIZZARD DRAWS NO SHEETS, and there is no count here to raise.
//
// Two attempts at one were tried and both failed for the same underlying reason, which is
// worth stating so a third is not started. The first was an imported sheet of soft diagonal
// STREAKS: a streak is a picture of a direction, its pixels lie on a fixed 135 degree axis,
// and the particle direction is rolled fresh from the server's per-sky token every
// occurrence, so the two visibly fought about half the time. The second reused the round
// snow planes driven twice as fast and leftward, which cannot disagree with anything -- but
// round flakes at snow's scale read as SNOW however fast they move, and a blizzard with
// tidy legible flakes in front of it reads as weaker than the plain snow beside it.
//
// What distinguishes a blizzard here is density and blindness: 280 hard particles against
// snow's ~40, and the fog.
// The blizzard's rolling fog: FOUR sheets at different sizes, shapes and speeds.
//
// One sheet at one speed reads as a texture sliding over the glass. Two was better and
// still had a tell: both were 800 wide, so both tiled on an 800 px pitch and the pair
// realigned every 800 px of relative travel, bringing the same coincidence of shapes back
// over and over. These four are 1024, 900, 640 and 800 wide, which share no useful common
// factor, so the combined pattern only repeats after their least common multiple.
//
// They also differ in HEIGHT and in where they sit, which is what makes them overlap rather
// than stack: a 460-tall bank low in the frame and a 240-tall veil high in it CROSS, and
// the crossing is the depth. Four sheets at one height and one size would just be one sheet
// at four times the opacity.
#define FX_FOG_COUNT     4
// The layer alpha each fog sheet reaches at full level.
//
// DOWN FROM 0.85 BECAUSE THERE ARE NOW FOUR OF THEM AND THEY MULTIPLY. Transmission is the
// product of (1 - a) over every sheet covering a pixel, so doubling the sheet count roughly
// squares the thinning. Measured over the composite at the injected offsets: 0.85 gives a
// 74% peak and a 50% p95, against the 55% peak the old PAIR reached. 0.60 puts the four
// back at a 58% peak, so this change is more shapes rather than more fog. Raise it only if
// a blizzard is meant to get thicker, and check the p95 rather than the peak: the peak is
// one lucky overlap, the p95 is what the player is looking through.

// This is the ONLY weather that swaps the backdrop rather than tinting it, and it works
// for a reason that is easy to miss: weather.cpp promotes the map's own backs in front of
// our injected band, but ONLY from index HILL_FIRST (2) upward. A v83 map's back/0 and

// mid-fade that 30 px strip composites twice and renders at 1-(1-a)^2 instead of a, i.e.
// 0.75 against 0.50 at the halfway point. That is a hard-edged darker stripe running the

// front=1, so it sits in FRONT of the map like the rain sheets do: fog that the terrain
// draws over is not fog, it is a sky. The near sheet is the faster and the thinner of the
// two; see the tool for why the pair exists.
//
// type 4 = horizontally tiled + scrolling, and cx is filled from the art at injection for
// exactly the reason the clouds now are: the drift wraps on the tile pitch, so the two
// have to be the same number or the sheet walks out of step with its own tiling.

// parallax is hardcoded to 0 for type 4 at 0x0063E0D8. At -14 / -26 that was a permanent
// 70 / 130 px/s LEFTWARD scroll that the wind-driven drift had to fight, so any rightward
// gust under about 110 left the fog visibly blowing against the snow.
//
// -1 leaves 5 px/s, under 8% of the drift floor, so the wind decides the direction.
// IT MUST NOT BE 0: the idiv at 0x0063DF2B runs BEFORE the rx == 0 guard at 0x0063DF44,
// so a type 4 back with rx 0 is a divide by zero.

// read out of the binary rather than taken from the paragraph above, which has the word
// backwards: MakeBack loads rx into esi at 0x0063DEE9 and at 0x0063DF2F does
// `test esi, esi; jle`, negating the delta only when rx is POSITIVE.
//
// The four rates are deliberately not multiples of each other, for the same reason the four
// widths are not: equal or harmonic speeds put the sheets back in step on a short cycle.
//
// IT MUST NOT BE 0: the idiv at 0x0063DF2B runs BEFORE the rx == 0 guard at 0x0063DF44,

// is 802x144 on a 1000x300 pitch and the near one 841x114 on a 900x500 pitch, so the tiled
// copies are spaced with a 198x156 and a 59x386 GAP. Abut them instead -- which is what

//
// ry is the fall rate on a type 7 back and the near plane's is double the far one's. rx=0
// is safe HERE, unlike on the type 4 fog: the divide that makes rx 0 fatal at 0x0063DF2B
// is on the type 4 path, and a type 7 back reaches it through a different branch. The far
// plane's -20 is a slow sideways drift, not a parallax factor.

// A type 4 back is horizontally tiled AND self scrolling. CMapLoadable::MakeBack builds a
// standalone Shape2D vector and gives it RelMove(x, y, now + 20000/|rx|, VM_FOREVER) at
// 0x0063E049, which is a constant 5*|rx| px/s in the -sign(rx) direction, forever. It then
// hands the entry to the tiler, MakeGrid at 0x0063E2C5, which creates one layer per tile
// and gives EACH ONE
//
//     WrapClip(Gr2D.center, -(cx + xSpan/2), -(cy + ySpan/2), xSpan + cx, ySpan + cy)
//
// at 0x0063EB96. That wrap band is anchored to the CAMERA CENTRE and re-evaluated as the
// camera moves, and each tile is wrapped into it modulo the band. So a tile's on screen
// position is a function of its own coordinates MODULO that band, not of where it was put.
//
// Translating a tile with InterLockedOffset therefore does not slide the sheet: it moves
// that tile to a different place in the wrap band. Two tiles land on the same slot, or a
// slot is left empty, and what appears on screen is hard edged rectangular blocks of sky
// appearing and disappearing. Three separate attempts were made to keep a wind driven
// drift and all three produced that artifact:
//
//   1. per entry drift        -- moved individual TILES, because g_vClouds holds one layer
//                                per tile plus a template, not one per sheet
//   2. cx filled from the art -- a no op; at magLevel 0 the engine's auto cx already IS
//                                the canvas width (0x0063E36A)
//   3. per sheet grouping     -- moved every tile of a sheet by the same delta, which is
//                                still a translate, and still lands them in the wrong
//                                wrap slots
//
// So the drift is gone. Speed and direction now live entirely in each entry's rx, which is
// the field the engine provides for exactly this and which cannot desynchronise from the

// KNOWN LIMIT: the field has exactly ONE weather slot. The builder calls
// WeatherLayer_RemoveAll before installing, so a second BlowWeather replaces the

//   - a player uses a weather item while it is snowing, then the world rolls off snow:
//     StopNative wipes the whole slot and the item's effect ends early
//   - a player uses one WHILE it is snowing: their item replaces ours, and g_nNativeOn
//     still names our effect, so the ambient one does not come back until the profile
//     changes or the player changes map
// Fixing it properly means observing the server's own weather packet
// (CField::OnBlowWeather, 0x00535179) so this module knows when it no longer owns
// the slot. That is a new hook on a packet path and is deliberately NOT taken here

// appending entries to +0x30's back list, which is only harmless because it only

// cached back list. Entering all 99 would leave 693 entries on it, the ranges would
// classify the newest batch as ours and every older batch as "the map's own backs",
// and those orphans get driven at full alpha: permanent opaque rain over the map,
// plus an unbounded list RestoreBack walks on every rebuild.
