// HOW THE GROUND EFFECT MODULES ANCHOR THEIR LAYERS
//
// weathersplash, weatheraccum and weatherpuddle all place sprites at fixed world
// positions. They do it by passing CreateAnimLayer NO origin and NO overlay and then
// plain world coordinates, because such a layer lives in world space and the engine
// offsets it by the camera itself.
//
// Both other approaches were tried and both are wrong:
//   - parenting to the avatar's under-face layer inherits the avatar's transform, so
//     the double jump front flip rotates every sprite with it. Passing a null overlay
//     does not help: put_origin carries the transform too.
//   - placing at (world - camera) and correcting per frame double-compensates for a
//     scroll the engine is already doing, which pins the sprites to the screen.
// There is therefore no per frame position work in any of the three modules.


// Splashes on footholds (weathersplash.cpp).
//
// SPLIT ACROSS TWO DRIVERS, and the split is load bearing. Intensity comes from the
// 30ms logic tick so splashes follow the same rain fade as the sheets and the sound,
// but spawning happens every RENDERED frame. At 30ms the spawn rate visibly beats
// against the frame rate and splashes appear in bursts rather than a steady patter.

// the rain intensity: the cause is the boot, not the sky.

// Settled snow / leaves / petals on footholds, and footprints through them
// (weatheraccum.cpp).
