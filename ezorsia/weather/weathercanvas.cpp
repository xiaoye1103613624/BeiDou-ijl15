// Building new sprites at runtime, from sprites the map already has.
//
// Two features need it and neither can be done any other way. A cast shadow is the
// object's own silhouette sheared onto the ground, and a swaying plant is that same
// object sheared a few degrees each way: IWzGr2DLayer can offset, mirror, tint and set a
// rect, but it cannot SHEAR, so the lean has to exist in the pixels.
//
// THE FAST PATH IS _LockAddress. It hands back the raw pixel buffer and its pitch, so a
// whole sprite is one lock, a loop over memory, and one unlock. The alternative, Getpixel,
// is a COM call PER PIXEL: a 300x300 object is 90000 calls, and there can be sixty of them
// on a map.
//
// THE FALLBACK IS CopyEx, which takes a destination SIZE and a source RECT and therefore
// scales. A shear is then one row-copy per source row, each nudged sideways. It needs no
// pixel access at all, and it costs the soft edge, because there is no way to blur through
// a blit. Nothing in this DLL had ever called _LockAddress before this, which is exactly
// why the fallback exists rather than being assumed unnecessary.
