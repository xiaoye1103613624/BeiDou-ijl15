// weapontint.cpp: runtime HSB re-tint of the worn Cash weapon (Coloring Prism)
//
// v83 has NO item-dye system, so the recolor is done here: the weapon's WZ
// canvases are cloned, transformed in HSV, and swapped into the WZ tree for
// exactly as long as it takes the client to build the avatar's action layers.
// The layers keep their own refs to the clones, the tree is put back, and the
// avatar is left holding recolored sprites while every other consumer of that
// weapon img (inventory icon, tooltip, another player wearing the same sticker)
// still sees the original pixels.
//
//   PrepareActionLayer(pAvatar)          <- Detoured here
//     |  Swap()      Character/Weapon/<sticker>.img/<action>/<frame>/<part>
//     |                   := tinted clone            (originals remembered)
//     |  <original PrepareActionLayer builds the layers from the tree>
//     |  Restore()   put every original back
//     v
//
// WHY THIS SHAPE, and not the two obvious alternatives:
//   * Recoloring the WZ canvas IN PLACE would tint the item everywhere and for
//     everyone -- the canvases are shared, cached resources.
//   * Substituting inside get_unknown / Ztl_variant_t::GetUnknown would put a
//     string compare on the hottest resource path in the client, for every
//     canvas it ever resolves.
// The swap window is the narrowest place where "this avatar, this weapon" is
// known and the canvases have not been read yet.
//
// PROVEN PRIMITIVES:
//   IWzProperty::item[name] = <value>                     (writes into the WZ tree)
//   PcCreateObject<IWzCanvasPtr>(L"Canvas") + Create()
//   IWzCanvas::CopyEx(..., CA_OVERWRITE, ...)
//   IWzCanvas::Create(w,h,mag,fmt) / cx / cy
// The one primitive this file introduces is IWzRawCanvas::_LockAddress, used to
// walk the cloned pixels. It is guarded and has a Getpixel/DrawRectangle
// fallback, so if it ever fails on this build the feature degrades to slow
// rather than to broken.

// purpose: MSVC refuses `__try` in any function that also has objects requiring
// unwinding (C2712), and _com_ptr_t / Ztl_variant_t both do. The smart-pointer
// half lives in CloneTinted, which uses C++ EH only.

// HOW THE PIXELS ARE READ AND WRITTEN -- and why it is this exact pair.
//
// READ: lock the clone's raw buffer once and copy it out wholesale. One COM call
// for the whole sprite instead of one per pixel.
//
// WRITE: `DrawRectangle`, batched into horizontal runs of equal colour.
//
// The asymmetry is not an oversight. Writing straight into the locked buffer was
// tried and it DOES change what the canvas reports -- a changed pixel read back
// through get_pixel after unlocking returns the new value -- but the weapon still
// renders in its original colours. So the locked buffer is not what the renderer
// consumes; there is a converted/uploaded copy behind it that a raw poke does not
// invalidate, and neither _UnlockAddress(rect) nor _UnlockAddress(NULL) publishes
// it. DrawRectangle goes through the canvas's own drawing path and does.
//
// Do not "optimise" this back into a locked write. It looks like it works, it
// passes a read-back check, and the weapon stays the colour it started.
//
// The lock is still used for READING, where it is only ever asked to hand back
// bytes it already holds -- which is the part that was verified to be coherent.

// Read the whole canvas into `out` as ARGB8888. Returns false if the lock is

// Every canvas slot in one img, resolved once and kept.
//
// WHY THIS IS SOUND: a WZ img is static data. The tree of (parent, child name) pairs and
// which of them hold canvases is fixed the moment the img is loaded, so re-deriving it per
// build was pure repetition -- measured at 16.2ms of a 21ms build, against 4.9ms for all the
// pixel work put together.
//
// The plan holds REFERENCES to the parent nodes and the source canvases, which pins them for
// the life of the process. That is deliberate: it is also what makes the plan safe, since a
// node that cannot be freed cannot be dangling. The cost is bounded by the number of
// distinct dyed imgs a session touches.
//
// KEYED ON THE LIVE IMG POINTER, not on the path. If the resource manager ever drops and
// rebuilds a tree, GetObjectA hands back a different object, the lookup misses, and a fresh
// plan is built against the tree that is actually live. A stale plan simply stops being
// found. That is the whole invalidation rule.
//
// `original` is the RAW slot contents captured at rest -- the alias object where the slot
// holds one, the canvas otherwise -- for the same reason the walk records it: restoring a
// resolved canvas over an alias destroys the indirection. A plan is only ever built from a
// slot at rest, because an img's plan is built on the first call that touches that img, and

// LOOK TINTS -- hair and eye colour (the window's Hair / Face tabs)
// =====================================================
// Hair is easy and eyes are not, and it is worth saying exactly why.
//
// HAIR. Character/Hair/000300NN.img holds ONE real canvas per layer and every
// per-action frame is a UOL pointing back at it: stand1/0/hair, walk1/0/hair,
// alert/0/hair, prone/0/hair and fly/0/hair all hold the string "../../default/hair".
// So three canvases cover the whole character -- `default/hair` plus `backDefault`'s
// two, `backHairBelowCap` and `backHair`. That last node is the trap: the equip walk
// visits { actionName, "default" } only, which reaches the front hair and not the
// back, and the result is a character whose ponytail is still the old colour.
//
// EYES. There is no iris layer to tint. A v83 Face img is one flat canvas per
// EXPRESSION containing eyes, eyebrows and mouth over transparency, and vanilla
// changes eye colour by swapping to a wholly different, separately drawn img. So a
// naive hue rotation of the canvas is wrong twice over:
//
//   * it recolours things that are not eyes. Measured over 117 default/face canvases:
//     a mean of 10 non-iris pixels per canvas are chromatic enough to move visibly
//     (brown brows/lashes at H~30, blue sclera shading at H~210-240), and smile /
//     angry / love carry 21-100 pure-red MOUTH pixels that a rotation turns green.
//   * it does nothing at all for the two most common eye colours. Colour 0 (Black)
//     is achromatic in 104 of 112 measured styles and colour 8 (White) in 102 of 109,
//     and TintPixel's hue rotation and chroma scale are both mathematical no-ops on
//     an S=0 pixel -- so a black-eyed player would see their whole face outline
//     brighten under the Value slider and their eyes never change.
//
// Thresholding the worn canvas cannot separate the iris either: those Black irises
// sit at S=0.000 exactly while 4-bit quantisation artefacts in the sclera reach
// S=1.000, so a saturation rule fails in both directions simultaneously.
//
// WHAT WORKS is to ask the artists. Eye colour is the HUNDREDS DIGIT of the face id,
// so the same style in another colour is one arithmetic step away, and DIFFING those
// siblings yields exactly the pixels an eye-colour change is allowed to touch -- for
// 00020000.img/default/face that is 10 pixels out of 416, the same 10 for every
// colour pair. Then the masked pixels are REPLACED from a chromatic reference and
// rotated from there, which is what makes the slider mean the same thing whatever
// colour the player happens to be wearing.
//
// Measured against a 7-variant ground truth: 1.5% of true iris pixels missed, 1.0%
// spurious (and those are achromatic, so hue and chroma are no-ops on them anyway),
// 91 of 117 canvases pixel-exact. On smile/angry the mask comes out empty, so those
// canvases are never cloned and the red mouth is never touched.
// The face family's hundreds digit is the native eye-colour variant. Keep the

// So the cache is dropped first, for BOTH 0x5DC layer sets, and only then is the
// reload issued.
