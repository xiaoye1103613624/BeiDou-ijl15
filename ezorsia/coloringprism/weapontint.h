// weapontint.h: the HSB re-tint applied to a worn Cash weapon.
//
// A tint is a hue instruction plus a saturation and a value delta, roughly what the modern
// Coloring Prism dialog exposes as Tone / Chroma / Brightness. The identity tint (all three
// zero) means "vanilla", so no separate "is dyed" flag is needed anywhere: on the wire, in
// the DB, or in this struct.
//
// THE SIGN OF `hue` SELECTS THE SEMANTIC:
//     hue  > 0   ROTATE the sprite's own hue by that many degrees (1..359)
//     hue  < 0   SET an absolute target hue, encoded as -(degrees + 1), so -1 is 0 degrees
//                and -360 is 359
//     hue == 0   leave the hue alone
//
// Both forms are needed and neither is right for everything. A rotation preserves a
// sprite's internal hue relationships, so a two-tone item keeps both tones; an absolute
// target collapses every pixel onto one hue. Measured over 235 items, 40% are not
// essentially single-hue and 30% clearly carry several, so a system that can only do one of
// the two is wrong for a third of the wardrobe either way.
//
// ENCODING ABSOLUTE AS NEGATIVE MAKES THE SIGN A VERSION TAG. Every record written before
// this existed is positive, so it keeps rotating exactly as it did and needs no migration --
// which is what lets absolute hue be introduced later without resetting anyone's dyes. The
// encoding is what makes 0 mean "no change" rather than "absolute red", and it costs no
// database column and no packet byte: SMALLINT is signed.

// These share the equip tint's table, its opcodes and its render hook. They are
// keyed by a KIND SENTINEL rather than by the hair/face WZ id, and that choice is
// load-bearing for four reasons:
//
//   1. Storage. Hair and eyes are not inventory rows, so an id key would imply a
//      per-(character, hairId) table; a kind key is six columns on `characters`.
//   2. The client already owns the id. Hair is AvatarLook.anHairEquip[0] and face
//      is AvatarLook.nFace, read off whichever avatar the renderer just handed
//      over -- for a REMOTE player that avatar's look is the only correct source,
//      so a server-supplied id could only agree with it or be wrong.
//   3. It deletes a duplicated classifier. With ids, CharacterSubdirOf would have
//      to reproduce the client's ItemIdToCharacterSubdir, including any runtime
//      widening of it; with a kind the DLL just says L"Hair" / L"Face".
