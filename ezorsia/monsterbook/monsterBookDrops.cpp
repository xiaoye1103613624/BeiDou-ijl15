// MONSTER BOOK -- drop chance % under each icon of the "Dropping" tab.
// FULL SPEC: monsterbook-implementation.md section 6.B (which supersedes section 3).
//
// The book is 100% client-side, so the ONLY thing the server owns here is the number: the drop
// chance at the asking player's LIVE drop / boss / card rates. That travels over the Kentakae
// pair
//
//     C2S 0x372B MONSTER_BOOK_QUERY  [byte 0][int mobId]
//     S2C 0x372C MONSTER_BOOK_RESULT [byte 0][int mobId][short n][ n x (int itemId, int ppm) ]
//
// with `ppm` in parts per million AFTER the rates, i.e. percent = ppm / 10000.0. The reply is
// cached per mob id and invalidated when the selection changes. Nothing is drawn until it lands
// (no placeholder, no flicker) and nothing is ever sent from a draw or packet path -- the query
// goes out on the main-thread flush like every other Kentakae feature.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// HOW THE STOCK PAGE IS BUILT (all of this is read off the exe, MapleStory.exe @0x00400000)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// CUIMonsterBook::Draw @0x00865782 (__thiscall, `ret`, no args) renders the RIGHT-HAND PAGE into
// a throwaway 220x290 canvas it creates per call (PcCreateObject("Canvas") + IWzCanvas::Create
// (0xDC, 0x122) @0x00865849) and, at the very end (0x00866A06), blits that canvas onto
//
//     (*(IWzGr2DLayer**)(this + 0xB20))->canvas[0]      via IWzCanvas::Copy(0, 0, page, <empty>)
//
// The layer is built ONCE in OnCreate at window position (240, 20) (0x008633F7 -> 0x00863409),
// so the layer canvas and the page canvas share one coordinate space and the composite fully
// replaces it every Draw. That is exactly what makes a POST-Draw detour the right place to add
// labels: we paint on the same canvas, in the same coordinates the icons were painted in, and
// the next Draw wipes and we repaint. Nothing accumulates.
//
// Draw reads its two tab indices at its head (0x00865792 / 0x0086579E) and dispatches at
// 0x0086590E:  left tab == 9 -> 0x00866961 (special page); else right tab 0 -> Basic Info
// (0x00865F96), 1 -> Episode (+0xE30, 0x00865DC7), 2 -> Dropping (+0xE38, 0x00865B7A),
// 3 -> Found In (+0xE34, 0x00865937).
//
// The Dropping branch is at 0x00865B7A:
//   * pages  = *(void***)(this + 0xE38), page count at pages[-1]
//   * page   = pages[*(int*)(this + 0x5B4)]           <- +0x5B4 is the PAGE index here
//   * slot i = page[2i+1] (stride 8, value at +4), i < page[-1]  (NO hard-coded slot count)
//   * the icon goes at the RECT this + 0xCBC + i*0x10: IconBase blitted at (rc.left, rc.top)
//     (0x00865CF7/0x00865D1B) and the item icon anchored at (rc.left, rc.bottom) at
//     0x00865D59/0x00865D8B -- item icons carry an origin of ~(1,33), so the glyph lands back
//     inside the 32x32 cell. Draw never reads rc.right.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SECTION 6.B DEFECT 1 -- "the labels only show up on the SECOND visit". ROOT CAUSE.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// CUIMonsterBook::Draw is NOT called per frame. The window paints through a DIRTY-FLAG pump:
// vtable slot 21 (0x00B3A034 -> 0x00861E5C, __thiscall, no args) is the per-frame Draw override,
// and its whole body is
//
//     for (i = 0; i < 3; ++i)                       // 0x00861E61..0x00861E80
//         if (*(int*)(this + 0xB14 + 8*i)) {        // pane i dirty?
//             Redraw(i);                            // 0x00866A9E: 0 -> 0x00863DF1 (frame+grid),
//             *(int*)(this + 0xB14 + 8*i) = 0;      //             1 -> 0x00865782 (RIGHT page),
//         }                                         //             2 -> 0x00865220
//     CUIWnd::Draw(this);                           // 0x009E067E, the shared base draw
//
// so the right-hand page is repainted ONLY when this+0xB1C is non-zero, and the pump clears it
// immediately. The client raises it on user-driven state changes and nowhere else -- SetPage
// (0x00866AF3: `mov [ecx+0x5B4],eax` + `mov [ecx+0xB1C],1`), SetRightTab (0x00866B0A: also
// +0xB24), the card click at 0x008679C5, 0x008633AE.
//
// The drop table arrives asynchronously, one round trip AFTER the tab switch that painted the
// page and cleared the flag. Nothing marks the page dirty when it lands, so Draw never runs
// again, so the post-Draw label pass never runs -- until the player touches a tab or a page
// arrow, which re-dirties the pane and repaints it with a cache that is warm by then. That is
// exactly the reported "open Dropping, leave, come back" behaviour, and it is a MISSING
// INVALIDATION, not a race and not a timing window.
//
// FIX: detour the pump itself (0x00861E5C) and, when new data has landed since the last paint,
// set this+0xB1C = 1 BEFORE calling through -- the same single store the client's own
// SetPage/SetRightTab perform. The client's own pump then repaints the pane on that very frame.
// No timer, no polling, and Draw is never called by us. The pump detour is also the only place
// where a CUIMonsterBook pointer is guaranteed live (we are inside one of its methods), so no
// pointer is ever cached across the window's lifetime.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SECTION 6.B DEFECT 2 -- 5 rows -> 4 rows, % below the icon.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Two client constants have to move together, and they were both re-read from the exe:
//
//   a) the RECT table, built ONCE from OnCreate (0x00861E99 -> 0x00861EDA -> 0x00863717) at
//      0x0086375F..0x008637A1 as 20 slots:
//          idiv 4 -> left = 36*(i%4) + 38   (`lea ecx,[eax*4+0x26]` after `lea eax,[edx+edx*8]`)
//                    top  = 36*(i/4) + 60   (`lea eax,[eax*4+0x3c]` after `lea eax,[eax+eax*8]`)
//                    right = left+32, bottom = top+32   (`lea edx,[ecx+0x20]`/`[eax+0x20]`)
//      and 0xCBC + 20*0x10 == 0xDFC, the next known member, so the array is exactly 20 entries.
//
//   b) the list builder pages 20 per page: `cmp dword ptr [ebp-0x1C], 0x14` at 0x008674CF
//      (bytes 83 7D E4 14), the counter incremented at 0x008674B3, the finished page pushed
//      into this+0xE38 at 0x008674E2. The Found In builder above it uses different locals
//      (byte offset in [ebp-0x18], caps 0x50/0x58), so this imm8 is the Dropping page size
//      and nothing else.
//
// We do NOT rewrite the builder's arithmetic (it would need a longer instruction encoding).
// We patch (b)'s imm8 20 -> 16 at attach time, after verifying the four opcode bytes, and
// rewrite (a)'s table from the pump detour, before the client reads it:
//
//      left = 36*(i%4) + 38          (unchanged -- the columns are not what 6.B asks to move)
//      top  = 48*(i/4) + 60          (row step 36 -> 48)
//
// 48*3 + 60 + 32 == 236 == the stock 36*4 + 60 + 32, i.e. the grid keeps EXACTLY its old
// vertical extent; the row that went away is spent as 16 px of air between the remaining rows,
// and the % label lives in that air, below the icon and outside it.
//
// Everything downstream adapts on its own: Draw bounds its slot loop by the page's own item
// count (0x00865BBE), and the page arrows are enabled from `pageIndex < pages[-1]-1`
// (0x00863DC5..0x00863DE9), so the page count follows the new per-page size.
//
// If the imm8 signature does not match (a different exe build), the paging patch is skipped AND
// the rect rewrite is skipped with it, so the tab degrades to the stock 4x5 grid instead of
// showing 20 icons in 16 slots.
//
// The only other reader of the rect table is CUIMonsterBook::OnMouseMove (0x008623F2), and it
// is DEAD CODE in this build: it walks the array from `this+0xCB8` (`lea edi,[esi+0xCC0]` with
// reads at [edi-8]..[edi+4]), i.e. one dword BEFORE the array the builder and Draw agree on, so
// every rect it assembles has left > right and PtInRect always fails. Verified with the stock
// numbers (slot 0 -> SetRect(380, 58, 300, 90)). The new geometry does not resurrect it for
// slots inside a row; at the three row boundaries the bogus rect stops being empty, exactly as
// it already does in stock, only 16 px wide instead of 4 -- see the report notes.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The list itself is built at 0x008673FE from the CMonsterBookMan record's `reward` array
// (record+0x10, filled by LoadBook from String/MonsterBook.img/<mobId>/reward): a straight
// in-order walk, no filtering. So with the paging patch applied
//     slot i of page p  ==  String/MonsterBook.img/<mobId>/reward/<p*16 + i>
// which is how we map an icon to an item id without decoding the row records (their item id
// lives behind a ZtlSecure fuse at row+0xC, decoded by 0x0042873D -- deliberately not touched).
//
// The selected mob comes from CUIMonsterBook::SetMobInfo @0x00866C2C (__thiscall, `ret 8`),
// which takes an 8-byte by-value card holder: arg0 = holder head, arg1 = CardRecord*. The card
// record is {+0 cardId, +4 mobId, +8 tab, +0xC count} -- LoadCardList writes the 0238.img node
// name (the CARD id) to +0 at 0x00684B55 and info/mob to +4 at 0x00684BA2, and SetMobInfo feeds
// +4 to "Mob/%07d.img" at 0x00866CD6. We read +4 BEFORE calling through, because the holder's
// destructor runs inside the original and may release the record.
//
// CMonsterBookMan::GetInfo is deliberately NOT hooked here: monsterBookFoundIn.cpp (spec §2)
// owns that detour, and two Detours attaches on one target is not a thing worth risking.
//
// SHARED RIGHT PAGE (spec §6, shared rule): monsterBookSearch.cpp renders plain item icons on
// this same page while an item search result is up, and those must carry NO percentages. The
// label pass returns early on MonsterBookSearch_IsItemResultView() -- and while it is raised we
// also stop counting the Dropping tab as "on screen", so no drop query is armed for it either.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SECTION 6.F / F3 (1) -- STALE ICONS. A slot whose item is NOT in the server's reply.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The ICON LIST is baked: it comes from String/MonsterBook.img/<mob>/reward, generated offline
// from drop_data (Cosmic tools/regen_monsterbook.ps1). The PERCENTAGES are live: the server
// computes them from drop_data at query time. So the two can disagree in exactly one direction --
// a drop deleted from drop_data (or one the server declines to report) still has a baked icon,
// and until the book data is regenerated that icon sits there advertising a drop that no longer
// exists. Before this change such a slot simply got no label, which reads as "still loading".
//
// Now, and ONLY once a reply for the selected mob has landed (g_chanceMob == g_mobId -- an EMPTY
// reply counts, it is still an answer), such a slot is OVERPAINTED with the page's own empty
// plate, `UI/UIWindow.img/IconBase/0`. That is byte-for-byte the same blit the stock Dropping
// pass performs at 0x00865CF7/0x00865D1B before it stamps the item icon on top, so the slot ends
// up looking exactly like the empty slot the client would draw after the book data is regenerated
// -- no new art, no new geometry, nothing the client does not already do to this canvas.
// If the plate cannot be resolved the slot gets a 50%-alpha grey wash instead (DrawRectangle
// BLENDS src-over on partial alpha -- verified in Canvas.dll, see runeMinigame.cpp), so the icon
// is dimmed rather than left looking live. With NO reply, nothing is touched at all.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SECTION 6.H / H2 (4) -- THE HOME SCREEN MUST NOT SHOW A MOB'S DATA.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Left tab 9 is the book's cover / "Book Master Lvl" page. Draw diverts to it at 0x0086590E
// (`cmp [ebp-0x40], edx` on the `leftTab == 9` flag computed at 0x008657AC) and paints the mandala
// instead of any of the four content pages -- but it does that WITHOUT touching the right-hand tab
// control, so `*(int*)(*(void**)(book+0xAE0) + 0x34)` keeps whatever the player last selected.
//
//   (a) That is why the % labels showed up over the mandala: the post-Draw pass only tested the
//       RIGHT tab (== 2 Dropping) and happily painted the last mob's numbers onto the cover page.
//       It now reads the LEFT tab first and bails on 9 -- and stops counting the Dropping tab as
//       on screen, so no query is armed from the cover either.
//
//   (b) Per the user's decision the right-hand content tabs are BLOCKED on the cover: from the
//       pump detour, `leftTab == 9 && contentTab != 0` writes the content tab back to 0 and raises
//       the pane-1 dirty flag, so Basic Info is the only page the home screen can ever show.
//       Writing the field directly is exactly what the client itself reads: Draw takes the index
//       from the CCtrlTab at book+0xAE0 (+0x34) at 0x00865792 and there is NO book-side copy of it
//       -- book+0x5B8 is the selected CARD SLOT (GetSelectedCard at 0x00867A2F feeds it to
//       GetSlotCard as the `index` argument) and book+0x5B0 is the card-grid page, neither of them
//       the content tab. The engine's own CCtrlTab setter (0x008603DF) is deliberately NOT called:
//       it is a 700-byte function that re-skins the strip and can call back into the window, which
//       is not something to run from inside the per-frame pump.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SECTION 6.H / H2 (7) -- BASIC INFO MUST RENDER THE MOB ART AT 0 CARDS. THE SECOND GATE.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Round 1 NOP'd the DRAW-side gate (`jle` at 0x00865F9C, "card level <= 0 -> skip the art"), which
// is necessary but not sufficient: with it gone Draw does build the art layer, it just has nothing
// to put in it. The real content gate is one function further back.
//
//   * Draw's Basic Info branch creates a fresh IWzGr2DLayer (0x00865FF5), parents it to the page
//     layer at book+0xB20 (0x00866030 / 0x008660A1), caches it at book+0xE3C -- and then fills it
//     by walking a FRAME LIST whose head is at book+0xE4C:
//
//         0x008661AC  mov  edi, [eax+0xE4C]      ; eax == the book
//         0x008661B2  test edi, edi
//         0x008661B4  je   0x0086635D            ; empty -> insert NOTHING, page stays blank
//
//     each node giving delay (+0x4C), a0 (+0x50), a1 (+0x54) and the canvas (+0x0C) to
//     IWzGr2DLayer::InsertCanvas at 0x008662A9. An EMPTY list is a blank page with working HP/MP --
//     exactly the reported symptom.
//
//   * That list is the ZList object at book+0xE40 (head at +0xC == book+0xE4C). It is wiped on
//     every selection by the clear helper 0x00861AB8 (called at SetMobInfo's head with
//     ecx = book+0xE20; the +0x20 slot it clears via 0x00416B72 IS this list), and refilled by
//     SetMobInfo alone, one of two ways:
//       - from `Mob/<mobId>.img/info/default`'s children if that node exists (loop at 0x00866F01,
//         reading `delay` / `a0` / `a1` per frame). That node is RARE in v83 Mob.wz -- 46 of the
//         2648 mob images in the repo mirror carry it, all of them boss / special mobs -- and an
//         ordinary card mob does not (Snail 0100100 is { info, move, stand, hit1, die1 } with a
//         scalars-only `info`). Mobs that DO have it were never affected by the defect, because
//         this branch is not card-gated at all;
//       - so for essentially every card mob in the book, via the fallback at 0x008671E5:
//
//             lea  eax, [edi+0xE40]              ; &the frame list
//             push eax
//             push dword ptr [edi+0xE20]         ; <-- THE CARD LEVEL
//             push dword ptr [eax+4]             ; mobId
//             call 0x008677CC
//
//   * 0x008677CC (exactly ONE caller, the line above) is a card-level-gated action picker. It
//     appends `(mobId, action)` animations, looked up through the singleton at 0xBE78D4 by
//     0x0040C831, whose action-name table is `[esi*4 + 0xBEC4C8]` (built at 0x004A6C05:
//     0 move, 1 stand, 2 jump, 3 fly, 4 regen, 5 bomb, 6 hit1, 7 hit2, 8 hitF, 9 die1, 10 die2,
//     11 dieF, 12..20 attack1..attackF, 21..37 skill1..skillF, 38 chase, 39 miss):
//
//         level > 0  ->  { 1 stand, 3 fly }          <-- THE SPRITE ITSELF
//         level > 1  ->  { 0 move, 2 jump }
//         level > 2  ->  { 12..20 attack*, 21..37 skill* }
//         level > 3  ->  { 6, 7, 8 hit* }
//         level > 4  ->  { 9, 10 die* }
//
//     So at card level 0 NOT ONE action is appended, the list stays empty, and Basic Info has no
//     art. At level >= 1 `stand` alone is enough to render -- which is precisely the in-game fact
//     the user reported (4 cards draws the sprite, 0 cards draws nothing).
//
//   * FIX: the very first gate, `jle 0x00867811` at 0x008677F7 (bytes 7E 18), is NOP'd, so
//     { stand, fly } is appended unconditionally. Card levels >= 1 are completely unaffected --
//     they already took that path -- and a level-0 mob now renders exactly what a 1-card mob
//     renders today. Nothing else in the picker is touched: the richer sets stay earned. An action
//     the mob has no node for is skipped by the picker's own null test at 0x008678DC, so no new
//     failure mode is introduced. The bytes are verified before the write; on a mismatch the patch
//     is skipped and logged, and the page simply keeps its stock behaviour.
//
//     This is a patch INSIDE a body nobody detours (0x008677CC has no Kentakae hook), so it cannot
//     collide with this module's own Detours trampoline on SetMobInfo.
